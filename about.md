## About Me

My professional journey began in university research in chemistry and computational science, where I spent several years developing software for complex chemical simulations and parallel computations.
  Later, I became a physics and chemistry teacher, combining my passion for science with teaching, while continuing to explore programming and introductory embedded systems through personal projects.

The background image on this site comes from an old Fortran program I wrote to implement a filter diagonalization method for quantum chemistry. This program ran on a Linux cluster at the university using MPI to distribute calculations across multiple nodes. It represents a turning point for me: combining programming, physics, and Linux cluster experience — and it’s still part of my journey toward more advanced software development.

Over the years, I’ve developed projects in different languages and contexts:

Chemistry Simulations: Interactive JavaScript programs that model molecular interactions. These started as teaching tools but also reflect my ability to translate complex science into working software.

Filter Diagonalization: A library in C and Fortran I developed for parallel computations. It shows how I approach solving complex numerical problems from scratch.

Electronic Simulations: Small Arduino and microcontroller learning projects that demonstrate comfort with sensors, electronics, and physics-based systems.

Raspberry Pi Projects: My current early-stage experiments in embedded Linux. These are just the beginning of what I hope will grow into more substantial projects, primarily focused on systemd, automation, and Linux administration skills.

All of these projects represent different phases of my learning and exploration. Some are small, some are complex, but together they tell the story of someone who is continuously learning, experimenting, and bridging the worlds of physics, software, and embedded systems.
